"""Native MCP-client configuration backends.

MCP standardizes the protocol between a host and a server, but each host owns
its own registration format and location. ``Base`` holds the generic,
client-agnostic mechanisms (JSON/TOML config-file editing, the
``ConfigBackend`` interface); ``Claude``/``Codex``/``Grok`` hold the thin,
client-specific classes and default-config-path lookups built on top of it.

This package has no dependency on the rest of ffl-mcp and is designed to be
reused as-is by other MCP servers from the same author — either by vendoring
it directly, tracking it as a git submodule/subtree, or (eventually)
extracting it into its own distributable package.
